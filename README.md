# MRF-SDK
### Multi-Robot Framework Software Development Kit

This project is dedicated to consolidating software packages, tools and examples used in Mobile Robotics (Ground and Aerial). With these resources in place, we hope that it encourages the development of applications that require multiple and different type of robots. The idea is to use robot's individual and specific strengths, together. This will open the door to applications that the robots can achieve while working as one.
