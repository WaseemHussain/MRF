## Nvidia TK1 Ubuntu Installation

The NVIDIA Jetson TK1 is an embedded Linux development platform using the Tegra TK1 mobile processor. The Tegra TK1 has the same features and architecture like many modern desktop GPUs but is used for development and research. 
To install Linux onto the development board, a serial cable must be plugged into the serial port of the TK1 and at the other end be connected to a host running Linux.



The NVIDIA board must also have peripherals, such as a keyboard, mouse, HDMI, and Ethernet cable for internet. 
When you first power on the TK1, you will see that there is not GUI and that there is only a command line. It will ask for a username and password:
•	Username: ubuntu
•	Password: ubuntu 
When logged in you will have to change directory and run an installer script found on the TK1. 

Then when the system is finishing installing the Linux drives, you should reboot the system. When the system is turned on again the TK1 will have a Linux GUI.
